# parking

We created this mobile application to make the user’s experience with our project simpler and unique. Our goal is to reduce traffic and waiting lines. The user should sign up first in our application then he can log in to our application, then user is automatically directed to our home page, user then has two options reserve in parking lot or pay the receipt after scanning QR code. 
Option (1): the user is directed to reservation page that displays the number of free slots in the parking, when the user presses the reserve button then user receives entry code. Once the user enters code at entry gate of the parking, the gate opens and the timer starts until user enter the same code at exit gate of the parking. Once code is entered the duration and total price is displayed in bookings page for the user to pay the total price in order for the exit gate to open. 
Option (2): As the user finishes shopping, QR code of his receipt is displayed on web screen in the mall. After scanning QR code the user’s gets the details of the receipt to be paid using Paymob payment method.
